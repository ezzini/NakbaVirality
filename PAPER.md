# **AraSentEval**: Shared Task on Sentiment Analysis and Swapping in Arabic  

### Hosted with OSACT7 Workshop at LREC 2026

## SHARED TASK PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

### Paper Structure (4 pages maximum + unlimited references)

#### 1. Abstract
Brief summary of your paper in a few sentences.

#### 2. Introduction
- Task description and importance; mention language(s) covered; cite task overview paper
- Your main system strategy
- Key findings, ranking, challenges discovered; include code URL if available (Highly recommended)

#### 3. Background
- Summarize task setup: input/output types (with examples)
- Dataset details: language, genre, size
- Tracks participated in (if applicable)
- Cite relevant related work showing your contribution's novelty

#### 4. System Overview
- Key algorithms and design decisions
- Resources used beyond provided training data
- How you addressed task challenges
- Include equations/pseudocode for novel approaches
- Provide concrete algorithm examples
- For multiple systems, clearly distinguish each configuration

#### 5. Experimental Setup
- Data split usage (train/dev/test)
- Preprocessing and hyperparameter details for replication
- External tools/libraries (with versions and URLs)
- Task evaluation metrics summary
- Put detailed implementation in Appendix if space-limited

#### 6. Results
- Quantitative findings: Official metrics performance and ranking
- Analysis: Ablations, comparisons, design decisions impact
- Error analysis: System mistakes, confusion matrices, error types, make sure to provide some examples.
- Clearly mark which data split used for each analysis
- Distinguish official vs. post-submission results

#### 7. Conclusion
Summary of system, limitations, results, and future work directions.

#### 8. Acknowledgments
Thank contributors, grants, anonymous reviewers.

#### 9. Appendix
Low-level details for replication that aren't essential for understanding main concepts.

### Formatting Requirements ⚠️
#### Templates and Style
- Must use: Official LREC 2026 style templates (LaTeX or Word)
- Download from: [https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)
- Follow: General "*ACL" conference formatting guidelines
- Do NOT: Modify style files or use templates from other conferences to avoid the paper rejection

#### Consequences
- Non-conforming submissions (wrong paper size, margins, font size) will be rejected without review

### Key Principles
#### Focus on:
- **Replicability:** Provide all necessary implementation details
- **Analysis:** Emphasize results over rankings; include multiple runs and ablations
- **Clarity:** Brief task outline (avoid duplicating task paper); use placeholder citations initially

#### Required elements:
- Cite task overview paper
- Follow EACL templates exactly
- Use title format: \<Team Name\> at \<Task Name\>: \<Your Contribution\>

**For popular algorithms:** <br> Citation suffices (no need for full mathematical details)

**Space management:** <br> Move detailed parameters/hyperparameters to Appendix if needed
