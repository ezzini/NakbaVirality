# Call for Participation: NakbaVirality Shared Task
## Multimodal and Textual Virality Prediction in High-Stakes Discourse

We invite you to participate in the **NakbaVirality Shared Task**, a new challenge focusing on predicting the reach and engagement of content surrounding the Nakba and the post-October 7th war on Gaza. This task operates at the intersection of NLP, Computer Vision, and Computational Social Science, aiming to understand information diffusion in highly polarized and emotionally charged contexts.

**Registration**: https://forms.gle/ufj2gqRyMrrdDs5f9

### 💡 Motivation
Understanding what makes a post "go viral" in conflict zones is critical for analyzing propaganda spread, public sentiment, and information maneuvering. This shared task challenges participants to model "virality" not just as a number, but as a function of nuanced text, graphic imagery, and deep historical context.

### 🏆 Task
We propose a single task:

**Multimodal Virality Classification**
*   **Goal**: Classify social media posts (text and image) into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** virality buckets.
*   **Input**: Text + Image.
*   **Challenge**: Aligning mismatched modalities (e.g., peaceful image vs. violent interaction) and handling "dog whistles."
*   **Metric**: Macro-F1 Score.

### 📂 Data
*   **Sources**: X (Twitter) and Reddit.
*   **Size**: ~2,600 anonymized samples (post-Oct 2023).
*   **Languages**: Mostly English (60%) and Arabic (10%).
*   **Content**: Posts related to "Gaza," "Nakba," "Palestine," "Israel," etc.

### 📅 Important Dates
*   **Jan 1**: Release of Training Data (3,500 samples)
*   **Feb 1**: Release of Development Data (500 samples)
*   **Feb 15**: Evaluation Period Begins
*   **Feb 20**: Evaluation Period Ends
*   **Mar 1**: Paper Submission Deadline
